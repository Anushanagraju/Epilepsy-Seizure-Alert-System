# Epilepsy-Seizure-Alert-System
This project is a real-time epilepsy monitoring and alert system that integrates IoT and Machine Learning (ML) to detect seizures and notify caregivers instantly. The system utilizes biomedical sensors, Arduino, and ESP32 to collect patient vitals, which are then processed using ML models for early seizure prediction.
